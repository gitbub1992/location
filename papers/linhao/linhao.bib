  review = {The title attracts me. Cell phone accelerometer and WiFi to do Activity
	Recognition.
	
	
	This paper uses recognized Simple Activities(running, walking, resting,
	sitting, etc. ) and the WiFi location information to do Complex Activities
	Recognition. An example is "if walkingis detected as a simple activity
	and the Wi-Fi yields information that tells us that the user is in
	a library, then we can classify the whole activity as looking for
	a book"
	
	
	The idea is OK. But little algorithm, and for the Android WiFi scan
	problem the paper has a setence "A 
	
	delay of 500ms is set between the scans." This can be an example to
	my motivation to measure WiFi scan speed, and point out the wrong
	multithread WiFi Scanning program.
	
	
	The related work is also OK.}

	I find this paper because I searched the google scholar using "activity

	Some problems:
	
	1. The cellphone is fixed in usr's front packet.
	
	2. The paper said " One contribution is the data that we have collected
	and continue to collect, which we plan to make public in the future.
	" But I can find no link of website in this paper.
	
	3. Is the WISDM project metioned in this paper open sourced?}
