  review = {This objective of this paper is just like its title. 
	
	
	Actually, I don't know why this paper can have 203 citations at 2013-9-8.
	The method used or the result getted in this paper is not that superising.
	I find this paper because I searched the google scholar using "activity
	recognition phone", reading it because of relevant ,  the 203 citations
	and the famous of SIGKDD.
	
	
	Some problems:
	
	1. The cellphone is fixed in usr's front packet.
	
	2. The paper said " One contribution is the data that we have collected
	and continue to collect, which we plan  to make public in the future.
	" But I can find no link of website in this paper.
	
	3. Is the WISDM project metioned in this paper open sourced?}
