  review = {The title attracts me. Cell phone accelerometer and WiFi to do Activity
	Recognition.
	
	
	This paper uses recognized Simple Activities(running, walking, resting,
	sitting, etc. ) and the WiFi location information to do Complex Activities
	Recognition.
	
	
	The idea is OK. But little algorithm, and for the Android WiFi scan
	problem the paper has a setence "A 
	
	delay of 500ms is set between the scans."  This  can be an example
	to my motivation to measure WiFi scan speed, and point out the wrong
	multithread WiFi Scanning program.
	
	
	The related work is also OK.}

	Actually, I don't know why this paper can have 203 citations at 2013-9-8.
	The method used or the result getted in this paper is not that superising.
	I find this paper because I searched the google scholar using "activity
	recognition phone", reading it because of relevant , the 203 citations
	and the famous of SIGKDD.
	
	
	Some problems:
	
	1. The cellphone is fixed in usr's front packet.
	
	2. The paper said " One contribution is the data that we have collected
	and continue to collect, which we plan to make public in the future.
	" But I can find no link of website in this paper.
	
	3. Is the WISDM project metioned in this paper open sourced?}
