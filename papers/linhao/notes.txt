在这篇文章里面“Real Time Activity Recognition Using a Cell Phone’s Accelerometer and Wi-Fi”，又看到了一句话“A delay of 500msis set between the scans.”。

稍微觉得可能可以做一篇文章，名字叫做“Simultanous Localization and Activity Recognition Using Smartphones”，也就是说把活动识别和定位同时给做了，并且相互提高准确度。

2013-9-12：今晚突然想到用 weka activity recognition ，来Google一下，结果挺好的，明天过来第一件事就是好好看一下搜到的结果， weka svm crf貌似也可以搜一下

发现这个android课程真心好呀！http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs65/cs65.html，里面也介绍了用weka来做活动识别

Boosting is available in the Weka toolkit.这句话是在这篇文章Activity Recognition from Accelerometer Data里面提到了，觉得挺赞。

看了mit和stanford合作的一个活动识别项目，wockets(https://code.google.com/p/wockets/)，觉得还是不错的，唯有一点就是项目貌似有点过时了。不过这个网页还是要mark一下的，http://web.mit.edu/wockets/ProjectsSoftware.htm。他们想要做的几个idea。
